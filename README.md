## Step 1: Building List

__Notice:__
Initially I planned to use parcels downloaded from data.detroitmi.gov, since these building data are more representative of what happens in reality. However, as I move forward, it became clearer that there are some mismatch between downloaded coordinates and the coordinates in course materials. My assumption is that there are some randomized noise introduced to protect privacy.

So instead, buildings are constructed in more routine ways as shown in notebook [Building_List.ipynb](./Building_List.ipynb)

## Step 2: Assign labels
